# LungCancer_Project
This project contain data from a Veteran's Administration Lung Cancer Trial, where 137 patients with advanced, inoperable lung cancer were treated with chemotherapy (standard treatment) vs chemotherapy combined with a new drug (test treatment). My objective is to do survival analysis on this data.
